# Golang Patterns

This project contains Go implementations of canonical algorithms and data structures.

Most of the implementations are adapted from the open-source Java project [Algorithms, 4th Edition](https://github.com/kevin-wayne/algs4). This isn't the first (partial) Go implementation of Robert Sedgewick and Kevin Wayne's classic algorithms, but hopefully it adds something new.

Eventually we'd like to add:

* Examples of Go templating
* Examples of Google Cloud functions
* ?
