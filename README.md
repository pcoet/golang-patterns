# Golang patterns

This project contains Go usage examples and implementations of canonical
algorithms and data structures. The algorithms and data structures are adapted
from the open-source Java project
[Algorithms, 4th Edition](https://github.com/kevin-wayne/algs4). This isn't the
first (partial) Go implementation of Robert Sedgewick and Kevin Wayne's project,
but hopefully it adds something new.
